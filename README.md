# Format Library

Format Libray is a public resource for learning about the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game and its competitive history in the West, which dates from 2002 to the present. Please note: trademarked artwork and card text is used for informational purposes under U.S. fair use copyright policy, and this website is not affiliated with 4K Media or Konami Digital Entertainment, who own said copyrights.

The foundation of this website is extensive coverage and insight into tournaments, players, and deck lists, spanning the history of different "formats" (eras). This is closely intergrated with a card database that is updated nightly. These databases (Cards, Decks, Events, Formats, and Players) provide a complete picture of the game's extensive history. The website was also built on the idea that these data are all related to each other, and one of my main goals is to facilitate the natural connections between them. 

As a former competitive player, I constantly ask myself "What tools do I wish I had to do my own research on the game?". I try to be creative and bold with my answers, basing them not on what is currently available from other applications, but rather what I can imagine. When I work on the code and framework of this project, I try my best to translate those dreams into realities.

This app was built with React and Material-UI (front-end framework), Express and Morgan (server), Chart.js (plotting charts), Axios (fetching external data), PostgreSQL (internal database), Sequelize (interacting with internal database), and Webpack (web bundler). Much of the internal data on tournaments and players is generated by RetroBot: https://github.com/danielmcnelis/retrobot.
